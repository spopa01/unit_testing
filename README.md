unit_testing
============

Simple "unit testing" like framework. The code is largely stolen from  RxCpp.
See https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxCpp/blob/master/Ix/CPP/unittest/testbench.hpp for license etc...

In real world do yourself a favour and use google's testing framework or similar tools.
